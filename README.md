# WorkoutTracker
Implementation of a workout tracker. This tool can track different types of workouts and export statistics linked to the workouts.
Topic of my final Java project for the FH Technikum Wien (course: "Introduction to Java")  

Project's sequence:
1. Import at least three persons' data from a csv-file (saved in the program under "Resources") and save it in a Person's list
2. The persons should perform several different workouts, which should be saved in a Workout's list.
3. Statistics regarding the persons and their workouts should be exported in a csv-file (also saved under "Resources")

All these three sequence's steps should be simulated in the main class "WorkoutTracker".
